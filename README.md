### Hi there, I'm Yevhenii! 👋

I am a **Data Analyst** and **Python Developer** based in Kyiv, Ukraine. Currently studying Applied Mathematics at **KPI**.

My superpower is bridging the gap between raw data and business insights. I don't just write scripts; I build automated systems that collect, process, and visualize data to solve real problems.
